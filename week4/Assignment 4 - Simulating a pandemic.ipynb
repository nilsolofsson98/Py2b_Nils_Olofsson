A susceptible person is someone that is not dead, is not already sick  has not recovered from the virus, which we say would make you immune.

    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Create a method infect_others with the parameters self and population. In the method create a variable person_encounters which should sample as many as self.average_meetups people from the population. To sample indexes from the population array you can use random.sample (Google it!). I recommend that you sample indexes and not the people themselves, a way of doing this is something like this: random.sample(range(size of population), how many you want). </li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Having used random.sample your person_encounters list should now be a list of 10 indexes of people from the population array. Write a forloop over person_encounters with a loop variable person_id where in each loop you generate a probability like we do in day_passes and then check if the generated probability is less than or equal to self.infect_prob, also since this represents the way of infecting another individual include in the if-statement a check for whether the person is not dead nor has already recovered from the virus (Note: since we are looping over indexes to check the status of an individual you need to do something like population[person_id] to get the specific person). In total your if-statement should thus include 3 criteria at the moment; that the prob variable is less than self.infect_prob, that the person about to be potentially infected is not dead and has not previously recovered from the virus. </li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">if all of these conditions are met set the persons condition to sick. if done correctly it should look something like this population[person_id].sick = True. Where person_id is the loop variable. </li> \n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Lastly we need to add a call to this function from day_passes. At the beginning of the day_passes method first write an if statements that checks if the person we are currently working on is sick (currently working on refers to self). Then, inside of that if statement nest another if statement which checks if self.init_scenario == False (we do not want spread to happen on day 0). If the criteria are met call the infect_others method inside the second if statement </li>\n",

    "<p>It turns out the community has experienced viruses before and once it becomes a known problem in the community villagers start vaccinating against it. Each person only needs one dose to reach full immunity, however worth of note is that being fully vaccinated does not count as having recovered from the disease. Awareness about the virus usually become apparent once it reaches about 15-25% of the population (we will thus go with the idea that once 20% of the population have been/become sick vaccination starts). For simplicity sake we say that 4% of the population which are neither sick, dead nor already vaccinated each day gets vaccinated once the process is started, meaning that the doctors cant really tell if someone has already recovered but they obviously can tell if someone already has become vaccinated. Lets save some lives! </p>\n",

The people_vaccinated variable should increment if person.vaccinated == True. Add the people_vaccinated variable to the return statement at the end of the method. Remeber to add the variable in the start_simulation method just as with the others! This allows us to track how many are vaccinated if we wish.</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Create a new method called vaccinate_population and for now just type pass inside of it as a placerholder. After the forloop in advance_days write an if statement checking if people_sick >= self.init_vaccination and self.vaccination_started == False, if both these conditions are met change the value of self.vaccination_started to True and add a print statement saying something alike \"At the end of the day {amount of people sick} have become sick and a vaccination process has been initiated!\". Just after this if statement add another if statement where you check if self.vaccination_started == True, if so call the vaccinate_population method.

    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">In the vaccinate_population method first create a variable called people_vaccinated_today which you set to zero. Then write a forloop that goes through the population with a loop variable person which represents each individual like we do in advance days. In the forloop write an if-statement checking whether people_vaccinated_today is equal to the daily_vaccination_threshold, if so break the forloop (using the keyword break) since we have reached maximum amount of people being vaccinated daily. Else if (write an elif statement) check whether that the person we are currently examining from the population is susceptible (i.e is not sick, is not dead and is not already vaccinated).

There was a lot to do but we have had a lot of fun along the way and hopefully you have learned to navigate the code and understand how to implement realistic things into our simulation. There are tons of more things to do to make it realistic, but this is a good start. In next week we will reuse this code to combine it with pandas and generate a dataframe which we will then convert to a storeable csv file. See you next week and once again: WELL DONE!!</p>\n",
